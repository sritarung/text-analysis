# Problem
Text classification is a machine-learning technique that is fundamental to natural language processing
(NLP), a field of artificial intelligence, linguistics, and computer science. NLP is the idea that a machine can
break down text to understand how humans communicate and convey information. With the rise of social media,
text classification is becoming more and more important since the amount of information increases exponentially
every second. With such insurmountable amounts of this data and the many ways it can be interpreted, it'd take too long for an
individual or even a group of people to analyze and understand this data. As a result, having machines analyze
and understand this data is much more ideal as they are fast, efficient, and donâ€™t tire, saving a lot of time and
personnel. We will  be discussing how text classification works and showcase its applications with
two supervised learning models and one unsupervised learning model.

# Solution
In the landscape of data analysis, where a substantial 80% of shared information exists in unstructured text, machine learning emerges as a critical tool for systematic categorization. This entails training models such as Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression, leveraging their ability to discern intricate patterns within text and assign relevant tags to individual pieces. Naive Bayes relies on probabilistic principles, assuming independence among features, making it adept at tasks like sentiment analysis or spam filtering. Logistic Regression, despite its name, is a robust classification algorithm, often applied to binary classification problems in text, such as determining if an email is spam or not. 

These models, however, require an understanding of language nuances, leading to the incorporation of techniques like vectorization, stemming, and lemmatization. Vectorization breaks down text into manageable vectors, while stemming and lemmatization simplify words to their root forms, enhancing efficiency in feature extraction. In parallel, deep learning techniques, facilitated by frameworks like TensorFlow, introduce powerful neural networks, such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). RNNs excel at capturing the sequential nature of language, providing a nuanced understanding of context and dependencies within text. This collective approach equips machines to navigate unstructured text effectively, unraveling its inherent structure and meaning with precision.
